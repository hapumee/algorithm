/**
 * Question :
 *
 * Given a struct array of type Height, having two elements feet and inches. Find the maximum height, where height is calculated sum of feet and inches after converting feet into inches.
 *
 * Input:
 * First line of input contains number of testcases. For each testcase, first line of input contains N, number of given heights. Next line contains 2*N number of elements (feet and inches for each N).
 * 
 * Output:
 * Output maximum height from array.
 * 
 * Your Task: Your task is to only complete the function of find maximum height from given array.
 * 
 * [My Information] 1 foot = 12 Inches
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=T<=100
 * 1<=N<=105
 * 0<=Feet, Inches<=105
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 2
 * 1 2 2 1
 * 4
 * 3 5 7 9 5 6 5 5
 * Output:
 * 25
 * 93
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Testcase 1: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are respective given heights. After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 14 and 25 as respective heights. So, 25 is the maximum height.
